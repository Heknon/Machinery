# DEFAULT MACHINE VALUES

# reference_block_type - is the type of block in the schematic that from that block all blocks are "mined"
# mine_radius - the mine radius from the reference block
# speed - every how long should resources be gotten in seconds
# max_fuel - max fuel the machine can have
# efficiency - the amount of fuel taken each resource get event
# fuel_types - the types of fuel the machine accepts
# type - the machine type: LUMBERJACK, EXCAVATOR, MINER, FARMER, ALL
# block - the block that when placed will build the machine.
# recipe - in order to make a machine you must use the CustomRecipes plugin. reference a name of a recipe to add it as a machine type.
